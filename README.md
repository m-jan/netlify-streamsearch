## Stream Search

www.stream-search.io

Stream Search allows users to search for the availability of movies and TV shows across streaming providers. It is a ReactJS app built upon the Netlify create-react-app template, utilising Netlify Functions to make requests to the JustWatch API and TMDB API. It currently only searches across the UK availability for 9 providers - Netflix, NOW TV, Prime Video, BBC IPlayer, All 4, ITV Player, Disney Life, UKTV Player, and Shudder.


### TODO:
* Redesign UI, improving layout, color, responsiveness, and animations - In progress
* Allow users to search by country, updating the provider list
* Allow users to go back/forward between searches, possibly using React Router
* Create database of movie availability, move away from JustWatch API, create custom API
